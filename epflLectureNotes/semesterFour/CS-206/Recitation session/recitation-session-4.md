# Exercise 1 : Implementing map and filter on Futures

In this exercise, you will come up with an implementation of the `map` and `filter` methods of Futures. First of all, spend some time as a group to make sure that you understand what those methods are supposed to do. Then, complete the following code to implement the two methods:

```scala
trait Future[T] { self =>
  def map[S](f: T => S): Future[S] =
    new Future[S] {
      def onComplete(callback: Try[S] => Unit): Unit = ???
    }

  def filter(f: T => Boolean): Future[T] =
    new Future[T] {
      def onComplete(callback: Try[T] => Unit): Unit = ???
    }
}
```

In the case of `filter`, if the original `Future` successfully returns a value which does not satisfy the predicate, the new `Future` should return a `Failure` containing a `NoSuchElementException`.

# Exercise 2 : Coordinator / Worker

In this exercise, you will have to implement a Coordinator / Worker actor system, in which one actor, the coordinator, dispatches work to other actors, the workers. Between the coordinator and the workers, only two kinds of messages are sent: `Request` and `Ready` messages.

```scala
case class Request(computation: => Unit)
case object Ready
```

The coordinator actor sends `Request` messages to workers to request them to perform some computation (passed as an argument of `Request`). Upon reception of a `Request`, a worker should perform the computation. Workers should send a `Ready` message to their coordinator whenever they finish executing the requested computation, and also right after they are created.

The coordinator actor itself receives requests through `Request` messages from clients. The coordinator actor should then dispatch the work to worker actors. The coordinator should however never send a request to a worker which has not declared itself ready via a `Ready` message beforehand.

Implement the `Coordinator` and `Worker` classes.

```scala
class Coordinator extends Actor {
  ???

  override def receive = ???
}

class Worker(coordinator: Coordinator) extends Actor {
  ???

  override def receive = ???
}
```

An example system using the Coordinator and Worker actors is shown below.

```scala
object Main extends App {
  val coordinatorProps: Props = Props(new Coordinator())
  def workerProps(coord: Coordinator): Props = Props(new Worker(coord))

  val system = ActorSystem("coordinator/worker")

  val coordinator = system.actorOf(coordinatorProps)
  val workers = Seq.fill(10) {
    system.actorOf(workerProps(coordinator))
  }

  // Now, clients should be able to send requests to the coordinatorâ€¦
  coordinator ! Request(println(3 + 5))
  coordinator ! Request(println(67 * 3))
  // And so on...
}
```

*Hint*: In order to fulfill its job, the coordinator should remember which workers are ready and what requests are still to be allocated to a worker.
