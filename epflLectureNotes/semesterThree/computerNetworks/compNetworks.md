# Computer Networks 

## What is the internet?
The internet is comprised of: 
1. **end system**: this being everything that sends or receives data 
2. **access networks**: A common access network is *DSL(Digital subscriber line)*. The DSL uses a customers preexisting phoneline. 
Hence the telephone line will carry data and telephone signals simultaneously with the signals being encoded at different frequencies.

The alternative to DSL is *cable internet access* which uses the existing television service cable. Fiber optics will connect the cable head end to end users through fiber optics but generally the cable head end to the internet connection is done through coaxial cables hence the system being called a *HFC(hybrid fiber coax)*
