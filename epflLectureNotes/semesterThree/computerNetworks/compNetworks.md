# Computer Networks 

## The internet
### What comprises the internet? 
The internet is comprised of: 
1. **end system**: this being everything that sends or receives data 
2. **access networks**: A common access network is *DSL(Digital subscriber line)*. The DSL uses a customers preexisting phoneline. 
Hence the telephone line will carry data and telephone signals simultaneously with the signals being encoded at different frequencies.

The alternative to DSL is *cable internet access* which uses the existing television service cable. Fiber optics will connect the cable head end to end users through fiber optics but generally the cable head end to the internet connection is done through coaxial cables hence the system being called a *HFC(hybrid fiber coax)*

Yet another alternative is *FTTH(fiber to the home*. Each home has an optical network terminator that is connected to the neighbourhood splitter from which the connection to the central office happens through one shared fiber optic.

### Who owns the infrastructure?
The internet infrastructre is owned by ISP(Internet service provider). However, there isn`t one global company that dominates the market. 

### Circuit vs packet switching 
In packet switching, the router waits for the whole packet of information to arrive and only then will it proceed to the transmission to the destination. Another difference is that the information may be sent immediately even if all the transimission capacity is taken, the information will simply get queued. In contrast, circuit switching which for isntance telecommunication networks use, first ensures the availability of a line and only then may the transmission occur. This is akin to how one is assured to find a place at a restaurant that requires reservations vs one that does not require nor accept any.  

### Network of networks 

The first step into connecting to the internet starts with having an access ISP.
